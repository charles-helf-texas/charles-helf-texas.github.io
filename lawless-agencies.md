<h2 id="content">The Threat Lawlessness Poses</h2>
<p>
	Citizens hold a society together with shared values and shared expectations of behavior. They make laws to reflect and specify these rules. When their government routinely disregards the rules and get away with it, public trust in the system erodes. And when their government inflicts punishments even on people following the laws, they learn to fear and hate their country. Over time, this transforms a previously stable country into a free-for-all, where the only certainty is in whatever citizens can get away with.

	<summary>Authoritarians fill government with cronies instead of competent experts</summary>
	The most important thing to understand about authoritarian leaders is that they <a href="https://www.mpsanet.org/dangerous-logic-of-ambitions-autocrats-quest-for-historical-immortality/">seek power for its own sake</a>. Fame, wealth, and political influence are all forms of power. Since the majority of authoritarian leaders <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/character-disorders-among-autocratic-world-leaders-and-the-impact-on-health-security-human-rights-and-humanitarian-care/9C1DE6A42288503BDA79791C5DFE8B5E">are patholigical narcissists</a>, they chase after anything and everything that reinforces their internal need to both feel and be seen as <b>powerful</b>. Nothing else matters more to them. Because of this, they fill vital government positions with people who agree with everything they say and do. These people are rarely the most competent or trustworthy, however. This leads to <a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/how-autocracies-unravel">gross inefficiencies and corruption in government</a> as these yes-men fumble their jobs, take advantage of their roles to enrich themselves, or even do both. Because they fall in line with everything their leader wants, their leader readily lets them ignore the legal consequences of anything they do. This is how authoritarians <a href="https://www.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/What-is-the-Relationship-Between-Kleptocracy-and-Authoritarianism.pdf">let corruption fester and spread</a> within their governments.

	<summary>The long-term effect is economic, social, and even military instability</summary>
	One of the earliest noticable effects of a transition into autocratic government is <a href="https://theconversation.com/is-authoritarianism-bad-for-the-economy-ask-venezuela-or-hungary-or-turkey-106749">general economic instability</a>, paired with skyrocketing personal wealth of the authoritarian leader and those in their circle. This is very often paired with <a href="https://commonslibrary.org/authoritarianism-how-you-know-it-when-you-see-it/">other conspicuous behaviors designed to strip power from the people</a>, leaving the authoritarian leader and their close allies with the freedom to do as they please. It doesn't take long at all before more and more citizens notice what's happening and feel the effects, whether it's the economic decay or the violation of rights that used to be respected. This causes an escalating back-and-forth where outraged citizens rail against what's happening and officials use their powers to quash resistance in ways that increasingly <b>violate existing democratic norms</b>. Throughout it all, those in power <a href="https://revdem.ceu.edu/2025/02/11/misinformation-autocracies-partisans/">lie to the public, change their narrative, suppress truth, and manipulate elections and other vital government processes</a>. After enough time, <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/history-is-filled-with-authoritarian-takeovers-americas-founders-hoped-to-prevent-them">violent transitions of power</a> become normal, and peaceful democratic process dies.

	<summary>Though America has experienced some of these symptoms throughout its history, we're experiencing far more today than ever before</summary>
	We're seeing a <b>too many</b> of these developments happen right now. This isn't the first time our country has taken steps toward tyranny: American history has several exmaples of <a href="https://polisci.brown.edu/publication/presidents-and-people-five-leaders-who-threatened-democracy-and-citizens-who-fought">Presidential attacks on democracy</a>, some of which have had lasting effects on our institutions. Some of what's happening now has happened before. What hasn't happened before, though, is the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist">sheer speed and scale</a> of transition into authoritarianism in this past year. Nor has a Supreme Court ever in our history exempted the office of the President from criminal prosecution for their actions. And what's perhaps more important is that many of the authoritarian shifts that are happening now <b>keep happening</b> throughout our history, such as Congress <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/when-congress-checks-out/">refusing to check an administration's overreach</a> purely because of political affiliation. The more often an authoritarian practice occurs, the more likely it is to <b>become permanent</b>.

<p>
	The best solutions to this issue revolve around redistributing power so that it's no longer concentrated in so few hands. One key component would be to have more rigorous laws safeguarding against tyranny. The other is to put more power back into the hands of ordinary people by enabling them to <b>remove and replace representatives</b> who violate their oath of office.

		<h3>Allow Constituents to Unseat Legislators</h3>
		<p>Currently, there's only one remedy for situations where a Congress member might be an active threat to democracy: Congress itself This is a clear and obvious conflict of interest, not to mention pointless in situations where Congress has numerous bad actors. Citizens in all states need to be able to take direct action through a special petition vote to Congress. If 3/5 of registered voters agree that the Congress member in question has violated their sworn oath of office, that legislator must be removed immediately, and a special election held promptly.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Reduce Partisanship Through Anti-Tyranny Laws</h3>
		<p>Too many times, Congress has decided to ignore their duty to the Constitution because the executive administration was on their team. That needs to stop immediately. To combat this, we need laws clearly defining the many egregious offenses of current and previous administrations as examples of overreach. We also need laws forcing Congress to take action against such steps toward tyranny, up to and including criminal penalties for legislators who refuse to do their Constitutionally-mandated duty and instead choose to defend authoritarianism.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Restore Watchdog Agencies' Independence</h3>
		<p>The actions of current and previous administrations are rife with examples of both the legislative and executive branches not only politicizing oversight organization efforts, but outright sabotaging them when it fits their needs. History has shown that investigative groups are too vulnerable when left under their control. To correct against this weakness, their independence must be guaranteed by law, with clear definitions of the various ways this independence has been subverted in the past and harsh criminal penalties for such behavior.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Prevent Further Abuse and Exploitation of Constitution</h3>
		<p>There are a variety of miscellaneous acts and provisions that, when given no restrictions, have been used corruptly. Presidential pardons handed out as favors to allies and family members. Wars started without Congress' approval, purely by technicality of not officially declaring them 'wars'. Officials in all branches being exempt from criminal prosecution, so long as they're 'doing their job'. Judgments being rendered final and immutable, even if they were clearly the result of judicial corruption. We need laws specifically to handle these (and other) kinds of abuses to preempt further erosion of our democracy into authoritarianism.</p>
