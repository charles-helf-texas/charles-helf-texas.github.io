I'm a caring and curious thinker. I have been from the moment I was born, and likely will be until the day I die. I tend to be private, though naturally, I can't remain completely private anymore. You need to know who I am before you can make up your mind about me, and I want to respect the time that you're taking to give me right now.

Much about my early life was rather inconsistent and riddled with change. My family moved all over the country, my father being in the military. I experienced a variety of economic lifestyles, from poverty to secure middle-class living. I also experienced a variety of home dynamics. Sometimes, my home life was relatively calm and peaceful. Other times, it was very tense, to the point that all I could think about was getting away. The happy and painful memories are as many and varied as they are intense. From my earliest memories, though, I remember loving my family very much, and wanting from the depth of my heart for us to just live happily together. School became my way of trying to make them proud. I was always curious about everything, and I could easily spend hours studying about whatever topic happened to catch my attention. My teenage years saw me graduating from high school early in 2006, and I immediately set out to tackle college with the same drive and tenacity that got me through my studies before.

In university, I studied a variety of topics and changed majors a couple times. Biology, philosophy, psychology, and sociology all utterly fascinated me. But, I needed to keep my financial future in mind, and so ultimately settled on a dual major of Computer Science and Criminal Justice Studies, the latter being a component of my instutition's pre-law program. I spent a total of 10 years in college, graduting in 2016. Throughout this time, I worked low-paying jobs in fast food, as an assistant martial arts instructor, and as a government clerk. I don't think I was ever paid more than $10.50 an hour, and I spent the majority of this time earning around $8.25. As I worked these jobs, I noticed the profound weight of earning so little while the cost of living was, even back then, comparatively high. By this point, my family was already financially secure. Between that and my (perhaps unhealthy) obsession with cutting costs wherever possible, I managed a modest existence. But, it never left my mind just how many other people didn't have the advantage of a financially stable family, like I had. With as much stress and tension as I felt about my situation, I could easily imagine just how much worse it was for others who didn't have the benefit I had.

When I eventually started working as a Software Development contractor, the difference in my entire existence was... a little overwhelming. Going from $10.50 an hour to $28.50 an hour utterly redefined my life. Immediately, some of my most pressing concerns disappeared. I was able to finally begin taking care of problems that, up until that point, had gone unaddressed for years. For the first time, it really sunk in just how oppressive and traumatizing my prior poverty really was. Before long, I also began thinking about just how many Americans were still trapped in poverty, whereas I got lucky and escaped. I also began thinking about how, if nothing was done, many Americans would spend their entire lives without ever breaking free. This was a paradoxically deeply relieving, yet deeply troubling, time.

(under construction)

Because of my upbringing, I've had the very unique opportunity to meet Americans across a wide variety of walks of life. I've also had the very unique opportunity to essentially choose from a couple of options which economic class I wanted to live in. I've had the very unique opportunity to work a number of minimum-wage jobs and also a number of incredibly lucrative jobs. I've lived in about half a dozen different states. I've worked a variety of minimum wage jobs, ranging from fast food to working as a clerk. When I got into software development later on, I worked very closely with a lot of other middle- and upper-class workers. Advertisers. Account managers. Attorneys. Chief administrators. Executives. All people making between upper 5-figure and 6-figure salaries. I did this because it was part of my job. I did this across a variety of business sectors, from banking to groceries. And, in the process, I learned how pretty much all corporations in America are structured.

The key takeaway is this: there are far more jobs in this country at the "lowest" pay level than of any other pay level. It doesn't matter if every worker in America were suddenly qualified for every single job available: there still wouldn't be enough decent-paying jobs available for all of us to make a real living. About one-third of us would be stuck barely scraping by until a higher-paying job opened up. Over half of the people I've known and talked to know exactly what I'm talking about because they've had direct experience with this exact kind of problem. People are told all the time that there just aren't any promotions available. But, if they "just hang in there and keep up the good work, they COULD be next" when an opening comes along. Just like all of their other coworkers are told. It's by design. And the aim of that design is to make those at the very top of the structure unimaginably rich, at the expense of those doing all of the hard work at the bottom.
