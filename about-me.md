Because of my upbringing, I've had the very unique opportunity to meet Americans across a wide variety of walks of life. I've also had the very unique opportunity to essentially choose from a couple of options which economic class I wanted to live in. I've had the very unique opportunity to work a number of minimum-wage jobs and also a number of incredibly lucrative jobs. I've lived in about half a dozen different states. I've worked a variety of minimum wage jobs, ranging from fast food to working as a clerk. When I got into software development later on, I worked very closely with a lot of other middle- and upper-class workers. Advertisers. Account managers. Attorneys. Chief administrators. Executives. All people making between upper 5-figure and 6-figure salaries. I did this because it was part of my job. I did this across a variety of business sectors, from banking to groceries. And, in the process, I learned how pretty much all corporations in America are structured.

The key takeaway is this: there are far more jobs in this country at the "lowest" pay level than of any other pay level. It doesn't matter if every worker in America were suddenly qualified for every single job available: there still wouldn't be enough decent-paying jobs available for all of us to make a real living. About one-third of us would be stuck barely scraping by until a higher-paying job opened up. Over half of the people I've known and talked to know exactly what I'm talking about because they've had direct experience with this exact kind of problem. People are told all the time that there just aren't any promotions available. But, if they "just hang in there and keep up the good work, they COULD be next" when an opening comes along. Just like all of their other coworkers are told. It's by design. And the aim of that design is to make those at the very top of the structure unimaginably rich, at the expense of those doing all of the hard work at the bottom.
