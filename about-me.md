I'm a caring and curious thinker. I have been from the moment I was born, and likely will be until the day I die. I tend to be private, though naturally, I can't remain completely private anymore. You need to know who I am before you can make up your mind about me, and I want to respect the time that you're taking to give me right now.

Much about my early life was rather inconsistent and riddled with change. My family moved all over the country, my father being in the military. I experienced a variety of economic lifestyles, from poverty to secure middle-class living. I also experienced a variety of home dynamics. Sometimes, my home life was relatively calm and peaceful. Other times, it was very tense, to the point that all I could think about was getting away. The happy and painful memories are as many and varied as they are intense. From my earliest recollections, though, I remember loving my family very much, and wanting from the depth of my heart for us all to just live happily. School became my way of trying to make them proud. I was always curious about everything, and I could easily spend hours studying about whatever topic happened to catch my attention. My teenage years saw me graduating from high school early in 2006, and I immediately set out to tackle college with the same drive and tenacity that got me through my studies before.

In university, I studied a variety of topics and changed majors a couple times. Biology, philosophy, psychology, and sociology all utterly fascinated me. But, I needed to keep my financial future in mind, and so ultimately settled on a dual major of Computer Science and Criminal Justice Studies, the latter being a component of my instutition's pre-law program. I spent a total of 10 years in college, graduting in 2016. Throughout this time, I worked low-paying jobs in fast food, as an assistant martial arts instructor, as a student worker in various campus roles, and as a government clerk. I don't think I was ever paid more than $10.50 an hour, and I spent the majority of this time earning around $8.25. As I worked these jobs, I noticed the profound weight of earning so little while the cost of living was, even back then, comparatively high. By this point, my family was already financially secure. So, even after I moved out of my parents' home, help was always just a phonecall away, should I have ever needed it. Between that and my (perhaps unhealthy) obsession with cutting my own living costs wherever possible, I managed a modest existence while keeping familial assistance to a minimum. But, it never left my mind just how many other people didn't have the advantage of a financially stable family, like I had. With as much stress and tension as I felt about my situation, I could easily imagine just how much worse it was for others who lived without that benefit. If it weren't for my family, I flat out wouldn't have been able to afford living without at least one other roommate to help with bills.

When I eventually started working as a Software Development contractor, the difference in my entire existence was... a little overwhelming. Going from $10.50 an hour to $28.50 an hour utterly redefined my life. Immediately, some of my most pressing concerns disappeared. I was able to finally begin taking care of problems that, up until that point, had gone unaddressed for years. For the first time, it really sunk in just how oppressive and traumatizing my prior poverty really was. Before long, I also began thinking about just how many Americans were still trapped in poverty, whereas I got lucky and escaped. I also began thinking about how, if nothing was done, many Americans would spend their entire lives without ever breaking free. This led to a period of my life that left me both deeply relieved, yet also deeply troubled.

One of the biggest reasons for those paradoxical feelings? Despite making substantially more money, I was actually working... less. Less often. Less hard. Just working all around <b>less</>. For <b>more</> money.

Over the next several years, I encountered coworkers who had never lived as poorly as I or others I knew growing up. Some of them had never been exposed to poverty, period. These were often people who believed poverty was predominately a choice, or a sign of some inherent flaw within a person. These were also often people who sincerely believed that they were working harder than those who were earning less than they were. What's more, many of these people genuinely felt like they not only deserved wealth more than the people beneath them, but furthermore expressed dissatisfaction with however much they were <b>already</> receiving. In short: with as much as they were out-earning others, quite a few of them seemed to believe that they deserved <b>even more</> than that. For comparison, I was earning around $58.00 an hour when I started really noticing these kinds of sentiments, and some of the coworkers complaining were earning even more than I was.

This wasn't universal, of course. I don't think it was even necessarily the opinion of the majority of office workers at or above my pay level. But, it was a lot more than I ever would have expected, considering the very real alternative that so very many other people lived through on a daily basis. Some of these people were software developers, like me. Others were advertising leads. Project managers. Domain experts. Executive officers. Attorneys. Chief administrators. Mostly people earning vastly more than the ordinary American, whose median wage clocks in at around $19.60 per hour.

One of the other big reasons for my mixed feelings of relief and guilt at my improving situation? The realization that companies throughout the country are specifically structured have a great deal of low-paying positions.

Over the course of speaking to a variety of HR personnel, accountants, department heads, and other employees throughout projects I performed with several different companies... I learned the cold, hard truth: even if everyone in America got a degree for a high-paying role and was genuinely competent for it, roughly 20% to 40% would still be forced into low-paying poverty jobs. At the end of the day, an incredible amount of money gets diverted from corporate profits to shareholders and top-level leadership staff. Mathematically, this means that there's less money to go around for other employees. To encourage employees in more sensitive roles to behave and not cause financial / reputational damage to the company, wages for these kinds of employees remain relatively untouched. The less power and influence a worker has over the company's functioning, the less money they receive. This is why, for instance, Walmart cashiers and stockers get paid next to nothing. If they get disgruntled, their ability to impact the company's profits is minimal. Conversely, software developers have the potential to utterly ruin websites and internal applications. Upper-level accountants have the power to reveal incredibly damning information about how the company spends its money. Attorneys can decide to become whistleblowers for grievous violations of civil / criminal law. Thus, they get paid plenty, to ensure that they don't cause problems.

The truth is, the workers at the bottom of the 'food chain' are actually the biggest contributors of productivity and income. If those positions go unfilled, the company makes no profit. Empty stores simply don't even open, meaning that previously stocked products sit unsold on shelves. Empty offices provide no services whatsoever to clients, whether those clients attempt to visit the physical location or call in. Empty delivery trucks drive nowhere, meaning that their orders remain undelivered and returns on those unfilfilled orders get filed immediately. Higher-paid staff are just flat-out not as necessary to a business' functioning. Yet, it's precisely these less-necessary employees who get paid the most, and it's the most-necessary employees who get paid the least.

Up to 40% of our workforce is kept in perpetual poverty because of greed. Even when I was receiving $75.00 an hour as compensation for my work, I couldn't just ignore that reality. Nor could I ignore another, equally unsettling realization: despite some of the richest Americans making more than I did at my peak, they <b>still</> acted like they were <b>struggling</>. Like whatever incredible, massive amount of income they were pulling in <b>wasn't enough</>. Like they <b>needed</> more. And for some horrifying reason, enough Americans <b>believe</> them when they say that to actually <b>support</> causes that further drain the working class and the impoverished to feed those wealthy peoples' greed <b>even more</>.

Because of my upbringing, I've had the very unique opportunity to meet Americans across a wide variety of walks of life. I've also had the very unique opportunity to essentially choose from a couple of options which economic class I wanted to live in. I've had the very unique opportunity to work a number of minimum-wage jobs and also a number of incredibly lucrative jobs. I've lived in about half a dozen different states. I've worked a variety of minimum wage jobs, ranging from fast food to working as a clerk. When I got into software development later on, I worked very closely with a lot of other middle- and upper-class workers. Advertisers. Account managers. Attorneys. Chief administrators. Executives. All people making between upper 5-figure and 6-figure salaries. I did this because it was part of my job. I did this across a variety of business sectors, from banking to groceries. And, in the process, I learned how pretty much all corporations in America are structured.

The key takeaway is this: there are far more jobs in this country at the "lowest" pay level than of any other pay level. It doesn't matter if every worker in America were suddenly qualified for every single job available: there still wouldn't be enough decent-paying jobs available for all of us to make a real living. About one-third of us would be stuck barely scraping by until a higher-paying job opened up. Over half of the people I've known and talked to know exactly what I'm talking about because they've had direct experience with this exact kind of problem. People are told all the time that there just aren't any promotions available. But, if they "just hang in there and keep up the good work, they COULD be next" when an opening comes along. Just like all of their other coworkers are told. It's by design. And the aim of that design is to make those at the very top of the structure unimaginably rich, at the expense of those doing all of the hard work at the bottom.
