Before you leave this site, it's really important that you understand something: my candidacy is about more than just fixing the incredibly dangerous situation our country's in right now. It's about undoing the corruption that brought us to this point, in the first place. It's about changing the way American politics works, from the ground up.

For decades, the vast majority of our representatives have made it clear that they couldn't care less about what we think. I'm breaking that mold right now, with every group of people I meet and every word they share with me. If you have any thoughts, comments, stories, or concerns, <b>please</b> use the form below to send my team a message! This movement didn't just materialize out of thin air. It grew from speaking with people and taking in what they had to say! The only reason <b>any</b> of this is possible is because people just like you trusted me to care and spoke your mind!

If the vast majority of our lawmakers actually listened and cared, they'd pass more laws that <b>benefit us</b>, rather than the wealthy 1%. They'd also refuse to pass laws that <b>harmed us</b> to benefit these already massively-profitable companies. What's more, if they were doing their jobs right, they'd be able to explain their policies clealry and truthfully. They'd also make good-faith efforts to include us in the decision-making and legislative processes<.

Since our current Representative, Nathaniel Moran, refuses to do that, I'll be the candidate he should've been all along. And I'll prove through my actions that it's not an impossible task. I don't need to be this district's elected representative to care about what people think, or to work with them to build good solutions. I don't need to be rich or powerful to meet with you all and earnestly take in what you have to say. By seeing me do the job before I'm even elected, you'll know exactly what kind of a worker I'll be for you. This upcoming election is a job interview for one of the most important roles in the country, and <b>you</b> are the ones who should decide whether someone is fit to do it.

Democracy in America is at risk of dying out because the people running the country stopped listening to you. And because of that, many of you learned to stop speaking. Through their actions, words, and attitudes, they taught you that your voices didn't matter.

Let's change that now. Together.
