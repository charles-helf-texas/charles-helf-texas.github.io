As you can probably tell, this website is still under construction :) don't worry, though! It'll be finished before you realize it.

Before you go, it's really important that you understand something: this movement is about more than just undoing the incredibly dangerous situation our country's in right now. It's about fixing the way American politics works, from the ground up. For decades, poltiicians haven't given a single shit about what we voters think. Send them a message by sharing your thoughts with someone who actually cares. If you have any thoughts, comments, stories, or concerns, PLEASE don't hesitate to send a message this way! This movement didn't just come out of thin air. It came from speaking with people and LISTENING TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY!!! The only reason ANY of this is possible is because PEOPLE LIKE YOU SPOKE YOUR MIND! I can't promise that I'll be able to engage in a private, in-depth conversation with every single one of you. But, I absolutely CAN PROMISE that I will READ what you send to me and TAKE IT TO HEART.

Democracy in America is at risk of dying out completely because the people running the country stopped listening. And because the people being governed learned to stop speaking, because they noticed that it didn't matter.

That changes NOW.
