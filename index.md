Before you leave this site, it's really important that you understand something: this movement is about more than just fixing the incredibly dangerous situation our country's in right now. It's about undoing the corruption that brought us to this point, in the first place. It's about changing the way American politics works, from the ground up.

For decades, the vast majority of our representatives couldn't have cared less about what we think. I'm breaking that mold. If you have any thoughts, comments, stories, or concerns, <b>please</b> use the form below to send my team a message! This movement didn't just materialize out of thin air. It grew from speaking with people just like you and <b>listening to what you had to say</b>! The only reason <b>any</b> of this is possible is because <b>people like you</b> trusted me to care and spoke your mind!

If the vast majority of our lawmakers actually listened and cared, they'd pass more laws that benefit <b>us</b>, rather than the <b>wealthy upper-class</b>. They'd also refuse to pass laws that <b>harmed us</b> for <b>their benefit</b>. What's more, if they were doing their jobs right, they'd be able to <b>explain their plans clearly</b> and make good-faith efforts to <b>include us in the decision-making and legislative processes</b>. Since our current representative refuses to do that, I will. And I'll prove through my actions that it's not an impossible task, even for someone who hasn't been elected yet as this district's representative.

Democracy in America is at risk of dying out because the people running the country stopped listening to you. And because they stopped listening, many of you learned to stop speaking... because they taught you that your voices didn't matter.

Let's change that now. Together.
