As you can probably tell, this website is still under construction :) don't worry, though! It'll be finished before you realize it.

Before you navigate away from this page, it's really important that you understand something: this movement is about more than just undoing the incredibly dangerous situation our country's in right now. It's about undoing the patholigical behaviors that brought us to this point, in the first place. It's about fixing the way American politics works, from the ground up. For decades, the vast majority of our poltiicians haven't given a single shit about what we voters think. Send them a message by sharing your thoughts with someone who actually cares. If you have any thoughts, comments, stories, or concerns, PLEASE use the form below to send a message this way! This movement didn't just materialize out of thin air. It grew from speaking with people just like you and LISTENING TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY!!! The only reason ANY of this is possible is because PEOPLE LIKE YOU SPOKE YOUR MIND! I can't promise that I'll always be able to engage in lengthy, in-depth conversations with every single one of you. But, I absolutely CAN PROMISE that I will READ what you send to me and TAKE IT TO HEART.

Democracy in America is at risk of dying out completely because the people running the country stopped listening to you. And because they stopped listening, many of you learned to stop speaking... because they taught you that your voices didn't matter.

Let's change that now. Together.
