			<h2>Why Are So Many Of Us Suffering?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Most Americans know that our country is facing incredible problems right now. It's no secret. Nor is it news that the core root of all these problems is 'money'. What maybe isn't so clear, however, is specifically <b>how</b>. Listed here are brief summaries of the four main threats to our economic and societal stability. These are the largest sources of disaster to nearly all Americans, explained in brief detail with links to provide greater depth and evidence. Each summary is accompanied by a button leading to more detailed dissections of the current effects of these issues and their causes. Each of these, in turn, contains a series of solutions that, according to a great many skilled professionals, have real promise and backing.
		<br /><br />
		Don't take this to mean that I'm not open to suggestions. Rather, think of this as, "what we know so far". I've spent considerable amounts of time speaking with knowledgeable people and checking their thoughts with existing research and literature. Based on what the majority of what I've found so far, this is roughly what the ideal solution set looks like. As with everything, I'm always happy to hear people out to make my understanding of the problems and my solutions to them <b>even better</b>.</p>

					<h3>The Middle and Lower Classes are Being Bled Dry</h3>
				</header>
				<details>
					<summary>Ordinary Americans are increasingly unable to afford even basic necessities, like rent and medical treatment</summary>
					<p>
						The relative costs of housing, vehicle ownership, healthcare, insurance, and even basic necessities like food have seen substantial increases since 1980, some of them quite massive. Factored into a single Consumer Price Index, prices today have generally <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">risen by around 400%</a> (i.e. $1 in 1980 was able to buy the same amount of goods as $4 today in 2025). Incomes, however, have not kept up. Ordinary Americans over this same time period have only seen an income increase of 54% over this same time period. The result is a reality way too many of us are painfully familiar with: our wages are buying us <b>profoundly</b> less than what our parents and grandparents were able to afford at our age. For many people, the American Dream isn't so much a 'slim possibility' as much as it is a cruel joke. Even for the more fortunate, financial stability is becoming more and more of an uncertainty. The modest wealth and security that many had worked incredibly hard for is gradually slipping away, thanks to a mixture of skyrocketing prices and pitiful wage growth.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<details>
					<summary>Many programs that Americans have invested their hard-earned money into, like Medicaid and SNAP, are being taken away from them</summary>
					<p>
						What's more, the social programs meant to safeguard hardworking citizens who fall on hard times are under attack. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security have been continually labeled as major sources of fraud, despite erroneous payment rates of only <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/setting-the-record-straight-on-social-security">0.3% for Social Security</a>, about <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-program-integrity-and-efforts-to-root-out-improper-payments-fraud-waste-and-abuse/">5.7% for Medicare</a>, and roughly <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-2024-improper-payments-fact-sheet">5.09% for Medicaid</a>. Now, the recent 7,000 staff reductions to Social Security offices have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/26/nx-s1-5368480/social-security-workforce-cuts">devastated productivity and generated panicked confusion</a> in an already strained system. The 80,000 worker reduction to VA offices, including a <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/veterans-affairs/2025/06/va-plans-to-cut-1000-it-positions-undoing-biden-era-hiring-surge/">1,000 reduction in IT staff</a> <b>despite</b> the current administration claiming a desire to modernize government processes through technology, is estimated to have similar effects. This is on top of absurd additional work requirements for these programs and SNAP, despite research showing <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/worsening-snaps-harsh-work-requirement-would-take-food-assistance-away">work requirements don't actually fix employment instability</a>. Americans who have ever needed temporary assistance from these programs can attest to how lifechanging they can be. There's now a very real possibility that citizens in the future will have no real option to turn to, if they ever need temporary help. To add insult to injury, small farms in Texas vital to food production are losing subsidies, crippling hardworking people who make one of the most important contributions to this country. All the while, regulations designed to prevent large corporations from engaging in <b>harmful and deceptive practices</b> are <a href="https://www.aarp.org/aarp-foundation/our-work/legal-advocacy/2024-supreme-court-preview/consumer-protection.html">being repealed</a>, further setting the stage for lower- and middle-class collapse.

					If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, many ordinary Americans will end up destitute, and only the richest will be able to live securely and comfortably in this nation.

					<h3>Our Federal Debt and Deficit are Out of Control</h3>
				</header>
				<details>
					<summary>Previous budgets have allowed for more and more debt, to the point that we're now reaching critical mass</summary>
					<p>
						Our Congressional budget has very rarely ever been balanced. In the past 50 years, there were only 4 annual budgets that <b>didn't</b> run a deficit: 1969, 1998, 1999, and 2001. This may make deficit and debt seem normal. However, we have never before racked up the kind of debt that we have now. In the year 2000, our national debt was roughly <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/us-national-debt-by-year-7499291#toc-the-growing-national-debt">$5.6 trillion</a>. In 2015, it grew to about $18 trillion. Today, not even a full 10 years later, our debt is now around $36 trillion. We have literally doubled our national debt in the past 10 years. And with debt comes interest. 10 years ago, the annual interest on our debt was about $0.5 trillion, whereas now it's $1.1 trillion. Of all the possible cuts Congress can make to the budget, interest payments aren't one of them. Interest payments to our country's debtors are inescapable. And the higher our interest payments become, the more Congress will need to cut from everything else in order to balance the budget.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<details>
					<summary>Much of our debt is from handing out excessive contracts and tax breaks</summary>
					<p>
						Beyond just the sheer amount of our excessive spending, though, is the ineffective proceses that Congress has used to try and curb it. Since 1960, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit">Congress has voted 78 times</a> to raise the debt ceiling. That's more than one raising every single year. On top of that, many choices in spending increases and spending cuts have done little to help the situation. As just one example, the Affordable Care Act contributes <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59273">roughly $1.8 trillion each year</a> to the federal deficit. Yet, despite health insurance companies <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/top-5-us-health-insurers-annual-profits-jumped-230-percent-since-acas-passage/">seeing record profits</a> over the past decade, Congress has made no coordinated attempt whatsoever to curb premium costs. Similarly, Medicare has been historically unable to negotiate drug prices with pharamceutical providers, despite <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/american-pharmaceutical-companies-still-arent-paying-tax-us">pharmaceutical companies reporting massive profits while paying little to no income tax for the past decade</a>. It wasn't until 2022 when <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-106996">even a modest nod</a> toward this problem was made, and Congress has still made no effort to actually get these incredibly profitable companies to pay proper income tax. These are just a handful of examples of consistent, systemic behavior of incompetence that has led us to a massive amount of debt and a dangerously deficit budget.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<p>
					If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, our debt growth will almost certainly spiral out of control, beyond our ability to repair before our country is forced to default.

					<h3>Political Corruption Ensures Most of Congress Ignores Us</h3>
				</header>
				<details>
					<summary>Political bribery causes lawmakers to pass bad laws that the people never asked for</summary>
					<p>
						Excessive money in American politics is nothing new. Comedians time and again deliver clever quips about what we all understand to basically be <a href="https://issueone.org/articles/all-expenses-paid-how-leadership-pacs-became-politicians-preferred-ticket-to-luxury-living/">legalized bribery</a>. Politicians receive exorbitant gifts and campaign contributions from dozens of large businesses through corporate PACs, then 'coincidentally' pass laws later that fit perfectly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272725000179#sec4">within those companies' interests</a>. We hear and see examples of this all the time. And we pay the price for their gains. Factories get emissions regulations removed to cut costs, and this causes <a href="https://www.curetoday.com/view/epa-deregulation-means-more-air-pollution-and-more-cancer-deaths">spikes in cancer</a> for the people who live and work nearby. Health providers add legal provisions to allow them to deny more claims, and this causes people to either have to pay for treatment out of pocket, get sicker, or just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/us-health-insurance-system-doctors">straight up die</a>. Mixed in with all of these actions that cause direct harm to people is legislation that enriches companies at our expense through <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-fox-news-op-ed-warren-sheehy-announce-bipartisan-fight-to-guarantee-military-right-to-repair-its-equipment">bloated government contracts</a> with the private sector, or redirects funding from more important and useful programs into <a href="https://www.wipfli.com/insights/articles/cre-tax-is-congress-bringing-back-100-bonus-depreciation">special deductions and exemptions</a> for the wealthiest individuals and organizations. Often, Congress members directly benefit through insider trading deals with the companies that profit from their enacted bills.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<details>
					<summary>The system encourages Congress members to actively ignore their constituents' needs</summary>
					<p>
						Through it all, legislation that Americans have actually wanted for decades (higher wages, improved job markets, reduced healthcare costs, and affordable housing, to name just a few) goes completely and shamelessly <b>ignored</b>. Worse, we're often given bait-and-switch bills that promise to deliver on these needs, then either never follow through or actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/12/upshot/gop-megabill-distribution-poor-rich.html">make the situation even worse</a>. Both <b>Republican and Democrat</b> lawmakers have done this. As if that weren't bad enough, we're now seeing situations where <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2025-05-22-missouris-republican-legislators-repeal-paid-sick-leave/">state legislators are overturning ballot initiatives introduced by their constituents</a>. If you don't know, a 'ballot initiative' is a law proposal made by ordinary citizens. It's also worth mentioning that in nearly half of all States, including Texas, ballot initiatives aren't even allowed. This has led to a situation where the laws passed by State legislatures are often far out of touch with what the majority of constituents think, with no recourse whatsoever possible. It's a direct result of legislators catering to lobbyists, special interests, and wealthy donors, instead of the majority. Rather than passing legislation to prohibit or punish this behavior, Congress has historically ignored such bills to die soon after proposal. Over the past 5 years, only <a href="https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22campaign+finance%22%2C%22congress%22%3A%5B%22119%22%2C%22118%22%2C%22117%22%5D%7D">152 out of 546</a> introduced bills on campaign finance reform were ever even considered for evaluation, let alone formally discussed or voted on.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<p>
					If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, corrupt Congress members and wealthy lobbyists will be empowered even further, and the status quo of "money buys laws" in Washington will become nearly impossible to overturn.

					<h3>Disregard for Law and Procedure Kills Democracy</h3>
				</header>
				<details>
					<summary>America originated in resisting a corrupt system of government that imposed its tyranny on the colonies</summary>
					<p>
						Bad actors in government have always been a concern. Cultivating a <b>healthy distrust</b> in government is an almost uniquely American trait, and is perhaps best embodied by Ronald Reagan's use of the Russian proverb, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">"Trust, but verify"</a>. While initially used in the context of Soviet nuclear disarmament, that phrase also appeals to many Americans' sense of our historical origins, forming an independent nation as a response to what is commonly believed to be 'monarchic tyranny'. Yet, a little-known fact about the tensions in colonial America is that <a href="https://www.ouramericanrevolution.org/index.cfm/people/view/pp0022">Britain's parliament was actually to blame</a> for the laws passed against the colonies. Although King George III certainly influenced the British parliament at times (earning him tons of criticism by our nation's founders), the Constitutional Monarchy gave him very little real power. It was mostly <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/george-iii-1738-1820/">the parliament's refusal to give American colonies the same fair representation</a> its British citizens received that spurred on the American Revolution. This distinction matters because, at its core, our country's founding sprouted from <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1750-1775/parliamentary-taxation">a legislative body that disdained its constituents</a>. This went far beyond just ignoring their legislative needs, extending to inconsistent application of existing laws and even outright violations of the rights individual colonists were supposed to have.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<details>
					<summary>The current state of affairs is actually worse than what our nation's founders experienced</summary>
					<p>
						What we're seeing today in the United States isn't merely a repeat of our origin story, but an actual <b>escalation</b>. In the 1760s, power was distributed across the hands of numerous parliamentary members. They needed to coordinate in order to enact the tyranny that our founding fathers experienced. Today, we're seeing a Congress operating in a frighteningly similar way We're seeing a President trying to rule single-handedly through whim in violation of the existing laws and procedures. Funding for many organizations beneficial to ordinary Americans was denied and diverted without Congress' legally-required approval. Personnel were fired en-masse without following the appropriate lawful processes. A religious department was established in clear violation of the 'Separation of Church and State' clause. Individuals and organizations using their First Amendment rights to criticize domestic and foreign leaders were struck with financial and administrative threats. Rulings by federal judges are being repeatedly ignored by executive branch agencies. The National Guard has even been mobilized against American citizens, in direct contradiction to the requirement of an <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406">open rebellion, a foreign military invasion, or an inability of regular law enforcement to execute laws</a>. Worse, the majority of our Congress isn't trying to stop it, but actively <b>enabling</b> it. If our nation's founders thought the British government of the 1760s was intolerable, they'd find what's happening now <b>even worse</b>.
					</p>
				</details>
				<br />
				<p>
					If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, the lawlessness will spread until our institutions and principles cease to have meaning, and Democracy in this country is dead.

			<h2>It's Now or Never: I'm Here to Fight for You</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Political reform doesn't happen overnight. And it doesn't happen from the efforts of just one person. Or a hundred people, or even a thousand. It takes tens of thousands of people (or more) who are sick of letting things stay the way they are.  deciding that they're going to take action. In this case, the action is simple: read my platform, and decide in earnest if what I'm saying speaks to you. If it does, <b>message me</b>! Share what matters most to you! Ask me the questions you think deserve answers! And, if you think I could be the best person for the job and can at all spare it, throw a $5 donation my way. This isn't about the money, but about making your voice heard and showing to the rest of the Texans living in this district that <b>you actually believe in me</b>.
		<br /><br />
		The more of you who show that I've earned your trust, the more courage you give to others. The more they will dare to have hope again. And remember: if it doesn't look like I'm gonna make the cut among 2 or more other candidates, I'll send out a poll to ask what <b>all of my supporters</b> want to do from there. If I'm not performing well enough, I want to avoid interfering with more viable individuals in this race. Because at the end of the day, this isn't about me. This is about you, and giving you a real, honest-to-god choice that you can be confident in and be proud of. I'm going to fight like hell to be the best possible option you have, and it's not out of pride or self-interest. It's because, quite frankly, it's been <b>too damn long</b> since we've had the kind of candidate that we really deserved.
		<br /><br />
		Whatever you choose: make sure it's a decision you believe in with all your heart. And if you decide that I'm it... from the bottom of my heart: <b>thank you</b>. I won't let you down.</p>
