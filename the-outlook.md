			<h2>Put Simply: Our Country is a Decade Away from Collapse</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Nearly every American knows that our country is facing some incredible problems right now. It's no secret. Nor is it news that the core root of all these problems is 'money'. What maybe isn't so clear, however, is just how severe the situation is. Or what we need to do in order to repair the damaged fabric of our legal and economic landscape. Listed here are brief summaries of the most disastrous issues plaguing us, the largest contributors to looming disaster for nearly all Americans. Each summary also contains a link to a more detailed synopsis of the current effects of these issues and their causes. Each synopsis also contains one or more possible solutions that my team has identified.</p>

					<h3>Our Federal Deficit is Absolutely OUT of Control</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Our Congressional budget has very rarely ever been balanced. However, we have never before racked up the kind of debt that we have now. From the country's inception until the year 2016, our federal debt was about $20 trillion. Today, not even a full 10 years later, our debt is now $36 trillion. That's $9 trillion in less than 10 years. For perspective, our federal debt hit a total of $9 trillion for the first time in 2007. Our country was founded in 1776. That means in the 213 years it took our country to accumulate $9 trillion in debt for the first time, it took us less than 10 years to add another $9 trillion to that debt. That's insane. And that's unsustainable. The annual interest payments alone on that debt are already almost $1 trillion. If we do nothing in the next 10 years, our debt growth will almost certainly spiral out of control, beyond our ability to repair.</p>

					<h3>The Middle and Lower Classes are Being Bled Dry</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The costs of housing, vehicle ownership, healthcare, insurance, and even basic necessities like food have seen sharp increases since 1980. Factored into a single cost of living, prices have generally risen by 379%. Incomes, however, have not kept up. Ordinary Americans over this same time period have only seen an income increase of 54%. The result is a reality way too many of us are painfully familiar with: our incomes are buying us PROFOUNDLY less than what our parents were able to afford at our age. For many people, the American Dream isn't so much a myth as much as it is a cruel joke. Even for the more fortunate, though, financial stability is becoming more and more of an uncertainty. The modest wealth and security that many had worked incredibly hard for is gradually slipping away. If we do nothing in the next 10 years, this trend will continue until people are either born billionaires or born in poverty, with no in-between whatsoever.</p>
