			<h2>Put Simply: Our Country is a Decade Away from Collapse</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Nearly every American knows that our country is facing some incredible problems right now. It's no secret. Nor is it news that the core root of all these problems is 'money'. What maybe isn't so clear, however, is just how severe the situation is. Or what we need to do in order to repair the damaged fabric of our legal and economic landscape. Listed here are brief summaries of the most disastrous issues plaguing us, the largest contributors to looming disaster for nearly all Americans. Each summary contains a link to a more detailed synopsis of the current effects of these issues and their causes. Each synopsis, in turn, contains one or more possible solutions that my team has identified.</p>

					<h3>Our Federal Debt and Deficit are Out of Control</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Our Congressional budget has very rarely ever been balanced. However, we have never before racked up the kind of debt that we have now. From the country's inception until the year 2016, our federal debt was about $20 trillion. Today, not even a full 10 years later, our debt is now $36 trillion. That's $9 trillion in less than 10 years. For perspective, our federal debt hit a total of $9 trillion for the first time in 2007. Our country was founded in 1776. That means in the 213 years it took our country to accumulate $9 trillion in debt for the first time, it took us less than 10 years to add another $9 trillion to that debt. That's insane. And that's unsustainable. The annual interest payments alone on that debt are already almost $1 trillion. If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, our debt growth will almost certainly spiral out of control, beyond our ability to repair before our country is forced to default on its debts.</p>

					<h3>The Middle and Lower Classes are Being Bled Dry</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The costs of housing, vehicle ownership, healthcare, insurance, and even basic necessities like food have seen sharp increases since 1980. Factored into a single cost of living, prices have generally risen by 379%. Incomes, however, have not kept up. Ordinary Americans over this same time period have only seen an income increase of 54%. The result is a reality way too many of us are painfully familiar with: our incomes are buying us PROFOUNDLY less than what our parents were able to afford at our age. For many people, the American Dream isn't so much a myth as much as it is a cruel joke. Even for the more fortunate, though, financial stability is becoming more and more of an uncertainty. The modest wealth and security that many had worked incredibly hard for is gradually slipping away, thanks to crashing markets and sharply rising inflation. If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, only the richest Americans will be able to live securely and comfortably in this nation.</p>

					<h3>Corporate Corruption Ensures Most of Congress Ignores Us</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Excessive money in American politics is nothing new. Comedians time and again come up with clever quips about what we all understand to basically be legalized bribery. Politicians receive exorbitant donations from dozens of large businesses through corporate PACs, then 'coincidentally' pass laws later that fit perfectly within those companies' interests. We hear and see examples of this all the time. And we pay the price for their gains. Factories get emissions regulations removed to cut costs, and this causes spikes in cancer for the people who live and work nearby. Health providers add legal provisions to allow them to deny more claims, and this causes people to either have to pay for treatment out of pocket, get sicker, or just straight up die. Mixed in with all of these actions that cause direct harm to people is legislation that enriches companies at our expense through bloated government contracts with the private sector. <br /><br />
					Through it all, legislation that Americans have actually wanted for decades (higher wages, improved job markets, reduced healthcare costs, and affordable housing, to name just a few) goes completely and shamelessly ignored. Worse, we're often given bait-and-switch legislation that promises to deliver on these needs, then either never follows through or actually makes the situation even worse. If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, Congress and wealthy lobbyists will be emboldened even further by the lack of action, and the status quo of "money buys laws" in Washington will only become even further entrenched in our government.</p>

					<h3>Disregard for Law and Procedure Kills Our Democracy</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Given the already dire situation we're in, patching the holes in our country is going to be hard enough, as it is. Recently, though, a new massive problem has come up: entire branches of government (as well as some of their agencies) blatantly ignoring laws and procedures. For centuries, this country has held together because of both the decentralized legal framework and the people who believed in its effectiveness in making an America that works for everyone. Our revolutionary war was fought because our predecessors rightly recognized the inherent danger and injustice of an all-powerful individual ruling a country through whatever whim took his or her fancy. Our predecessors understood the necessity of keeping power split apart and distributed, so that no single bad actor could arbitrarily and single-handedly dismantle what was supposed to be a country founded on the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, Democracy will fall.</p>

			<h2>It's Now or Never: You Are The Answer</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Political reform doesn't happen overnight. And it doesn't happen from the efforts of just one person. Or ten people, or a thousand. It takes tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of people who are sick of letting things stay the way they are and deciding that they're going to take action. In this case, the action is simple: read my platform, and decide in earnest if what I'm saying speaks to you. If it does, message me! Say <b>anything</b> that comes to mind! And, if you can at all spare it, throw a $1 donation my way. This isn't about the money, but about making your voice heard and showing to the rest of the Texans living in this district that <b>you think I'm really on to something</b>.
		The more of you who show that you're willing to vote for me, the more courage you give to others to do the same thing. And remember: if it doesn't look like I'm gonna make the cut, I <b>will</b> send out a poll to ask what <b>all of my supporters</b> want to do from there. Because at the end of the day, this isn't about me. This is about you, and giving you a real, honest-to-god choice that you can be confident in and be proud of. I'm going to fight like hell to be the best possible candidate I can be, and it's not out of pride or self-interest. It's because, quite frankly, it's been a long time since I've seen a Congressional candidate that I truly felt was going to bat for me and actually <b>knew</b> what they were doing.
		Whatever you choose: make sure it's a decision you believe in <b>with all your heart</b>. And if you decide I'm it... I will do absolutely everything in my power to give you the representation and the voice you deserve.</p>
