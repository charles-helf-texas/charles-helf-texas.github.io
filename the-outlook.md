			<h2>Put Simply: Our Country is a Decade Away from Collapse</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Nearly every American knows that our country is facing some incredible problems right now. It's no secret. Nor is it news that the core root of all these problems is 'money'. What maybe isn't so clear, however, is perhaps how money specifically factors into these problems, or just how severe the situation is. Listed here are brief summaries of the most disastrous issues plaguing us, the largest contributors to looming disaster for nearly all Americans. Each summary contains a link to a more detailed explanation of the current effects of these issues and their causes. Each explanation, in turn, contains one or more possible solutions that my team has identified. Though I have the humility to be open to other options, there's lots of evidence showing in at least a rough sense what we need to do in order to repair the damaged fabric of our legal and economic landscape. And so far, the evidence is showing that the problems we face (as well as the potential fixes for them) look something like what you'll find here.</p>

					<h3>Our Federal Debt and Deficit are Out of Control</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Our Congressional budget has very rarely ever been balanced. In the past 50 years, there were only 4 budgets that didn't run a deficit (1969, 1998, 1999, and 2001). This may make deficit and debt seem normal. However, we have never before racked up the kind of debt that we have now. In the year 2000, our national debt was roughly <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/us-national-debt-by-year-7499291#toc-the-growing-national-debt">$5.6 trillion</a>. In 2015, it grew to about $18 trillion. Today, not even a full 10 years later, our debt is now around $36 trillion. We have literally doubled our national debt in the past 10 years. And with debt comes interest. 10 years ago, the annual interest on our debt was about $0.5 trillion, whereas now it's $1.1 trillion. Of all the possible cuts Congress can make to the budget, interest payments aren't one of them. Interest payments to our country's debtors are inescapable. And the higher our interest payments become, the more Congress will need to cut from everything else in order to balance the budget.<br /><br />
				Beyond just the sheer amount of our excessive spending, though, is the ineffective proceses that Congress has used to try and curb it. Since 1960, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit">Congress has voted 78 times</a> to raise the debt ceiling. That's more than one raising every single year. On top of that, many choices in spending increases and spending cuts have done little to help the situation. As just one example, the Affordable Care Act contributes <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59273">roughly $1.8 trillion each year</a> to the federal deficit. Yet, despite health insurance companies <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/top-5-us-health-insurers-annual-profits-jumped-230-percent-since-acas-passage/">seeing record profits</a> over the past decade, Congress has made no coordinated attempt whatsoever to curb premium costs. Similarly, Medicare has been historically unable to negotiate drug prices with pharamceutical providers, despite <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/american-pharmaceutical-companies-still-arent-paying-tax-us">pharmaceutical companies reporting massive profits while paying little to no income tax for the past decade</a>. It wasn't until 2022 when <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-106996">even a modest nod</a> toward this problem was made, and Congress has still made no effort to actually get these incredibly profitable companies to pay proper income tax. These are just a handful of examples of consistent, systemic behavior of incompetence that has led us to a massive amount of debt and a dangerously deficit budget.<br /><br />
				If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, our debt growth will almost certainly spiral out of control, beyond our ability to repair before our country is forced to default.</p>

					<h3>The Middle and Lower Classes are Being Bled Dry</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The relative costs of housing, vehicle ownership, healthcare, insurance, and even basic necessities like food have seen substantial increases since 1980, some of them quite massive. Factored into a single Consumer Price Index, prices today have generally <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">risen by around 400%</a> (i.e. $1 in 1980 was able to buy the same amount of goods as $4 today in 2025). Incomes, however, have not kept up. Ordinary Americans over this same time period have only seen an income increase of 54% over this same time period. The result is a reality way too many of us are painfully familiar with: our incomes are buying us <b>profoundly</b> less than what our parents and grandparents were able to afford at our age. For many people, the American Dream isn't so much a 'slim possibility' as much as it is a cruel joke. Even for the more fortunate, financial stability is becoming more and more of an uncertainty. The modest wealth and security that many had worked incredibly hard for is gradually slipping away, thanks to a mixture of skyrocketing prices and pitiful wage growth. <br /><br />
				What's more, the social programs meant to safeguard hardworking citizens who fall on hard times are under attack. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security have been chipped and whittled away at off and on for decades. Now, there's legislation proposing major slashing to these programs. On top of that, Veterans' Affairs funding and staffing has been cut drastically. Texans who have ever needed temporary assistance from these programs can attest to how lifechanging the benefits can be. We're now facing the very real possibility that Texans in the future, if they ever need temporary financial help, will have no real option to turn to. Funding for small farms in Texas vital to food production is also being slashed, a change that could cripple honest, hardworking people who make one of the most important contributions to this country. To top it all off, regulations designed to prevent large corporations from engaging in abusive and deceptive practices against consumers and smaller competitors alike are being repealed, further setting the stage for lower- and middle-class collapse. <br /><br />
				If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, many ordinary Americans will end up destitute, and only the richest will be able to live securely and comfortably in this nation.</p>

					<h3>Corporate Corruption Ensures Most of Congress Ignores Us</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Excessive money in American politics is nothing new. Comedians time and again come up with clever quips about what we all understand to basically be legalized bribery. Politicians receive exorbitant donations from dozens of large businesses through corporate PACs, then 'coincidentally' pass laws later that fit perfectly within those companies' interests. We hear and see examples of this all the time. And we pay the price for their gains. Factories get emissions regulations removed to cut costs, and this causes spikes in cancer for the people who live and work nearby. Health providers add legal provisions to allow them to deny more claims, and this causes people to either have to pay for treatment out of pocket, get sicker, or just straight up die. Mixed in with all of these actions that cause direct harm to people is legislation that enriches companies at our expense through bloated government contracts with the private sector, or redirects funding from more important and useful programs into special deductions and exemptions for the wealthiest individuals and organizations. Often, Congress members directly benefit through insider trading deals with the companies that benefit from their bills. <br /><br />
				Through it all, legislation that Americans have actually wanted for decades (higher wages, improved job markets, reduced healthcare costs, and affordable housing, to name just a few) goes completely and shamelessly ignored. Worse, we're often given bait-and-switch legislation that promises to deliver on these needs, then either never follows through or actually makes the situation even worse. As if that weren't bad enough, we're now seeing situations where <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/2025-05-22-missouris-republican-legislators-repeal-paid-sick-leave/">state legislators are overturning ballot initiatives introduced by their constituents</a>. In nearly half of all States (including Texas), ballot initiatives (law proposals by ordinary citizens brought by popular petition) aren't even allowed. This has led to a situation where the laws passed by State legislatures are often far out of touch with what the majority of constituents think. It's also a direct result of legislators catering to lobbyists, special interests, and wealthy donors, rather than the will of the people. Rather than even consider proposing legislation to prohibit or punish this behavior, Congress has historically done quite the opposite. <br /><br />
					If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, Congress and wealthy lobbyists will be emboldened and empowered even further, and the status quo of "money buys laws" in Washington will only become more deeply entrenched in our government.</p>

					<h3>Disregard for Law and Procedure Kills Our Democracy</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Given the already dire situation we're in, patching the holes in our country is going to be hard enough. Recently, though, a new massive problem has come up: entire branches of government (as well as some of their agencies) blatantly ignoring existing laws and procedures. For centuries, this country has held together because of both the decentralized legal framework and the people who believed in its effectiveness in making an America that works for everyone. Our revolutionary war was fought because our predecessors rightly recognized the inherent danger and injustice of an all-powerful individual ruling a country through whatever whim took his or her fancy. Our predecessors understood the necessity of keeping power split apart and distributed, so that no single bad actor could arbitrarily and single-handedly dismantle what was supposed to be a country founded on the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If we do nothing about this in the next 10 years, Democracy will fall.</p>

			<h2>It's Now or Never: You Are The Answer</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Political reform doesn't happen overnight. And it doesn't happen from the efforts of just one person. Or ten people, or a thousand. It takes tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of people who are sick of letting things stay the way they are and deciding that they're going to take action. In this case, the action is simple: read my platform, and decide in earnest if what I'm saying speaks to you. If it does, message me! Say <b>anything</b> that comes to mind! And, if you can at all spare it, throw a $1 donation my way. This isn't about the money, but about making your voice heard and showing to the rest of the Texans living in this district that <b>you think I'm really on to something</b>. <br /><br />
		The more of you who show that you're willing to vote for me, the more courage you give to others to do the same thing. And remember: if it doesn't look like I'm gonna make the cut, I <b>will</b> send out a poll to ask what <b>all of my supporters</b> want to do from there. Because at the end of the day, this isn't about me. This is about you, and giving you a real, honest-to-god choice that you can be confident in and be proud of. I'm going to fight like hell to be the best possible candidate I can be, and it's not out of pride or self-interest. It's because, quite frankly, it's been a long time since I've seen a Congressional candidate that I truly felt was going to bat for me and actually <b>knew</b> what they were doing.
		Whatever you choose: make sure it's a decision you believe in <b>with all your heart</b>. And if you decide I'm it... I will do absolutely everything in my power to give you the representation and the voice you deserve.</p>
