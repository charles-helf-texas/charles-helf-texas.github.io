<h1>The Simplest Answer</h1>

I can give three good reasons why you should at least consider voting for me. First, I have the skills to find <b>good solutions</b> to our country's problems. I also have the genuine desire to <b>do right</b> by <b>the majority</b>, rather than the wealthy few. Perhaps most importantly, I have <b>no other interests</b> beyond the honest purpose our founding fathers intended for members of Congress. That's the straightest answer I can give, pure and true. If that's all you needed to hear... great! On the other hand, if you'd like a little more detail on those three points, then please read on.

<h2>I Abide By Honest Principles</h2>

I don't own any stocks, shares, businesses, or even rental property. My car is serviceable, but not luxurious. My lifestyle is humble, rather than extravagent. And I have a deeply-held belief that the only income I should ever receive is the income I earn with my own two hands. If I'm not doing something that directly and logically translates to either work or trade, then I don't want to pull any income from it. <b>Especially</b> not if someone else is doing the work for me. I live my life as a person of earnest convictions, filled with a fervent belief that financial success should be <b>earned</b>, rather than an accident or luck. I also feel an obligation to keep from troubling others, so long as they don't trouble me. The Golden Rule and all that.

It also bears mentioning that I've lived in poverty before. I know exactly how hard life on low wages can be. And I also know exactly how far even the smallest amount of extra money can be stretched out for. That means I have a real appreciation and respect for just how much a Congressional salary is. At $174,000 a year, no member of Congress has <b>any excuse whatsoever</b> to pander to special interests or lobbyists in exchange for <b>even more</b> money. Most Americans can only <b>dream</b> of making that kind of salary, even just for a single year. To live on a Congress member's salary and <b>still</b> not be satisfied, in my eyes, is the ultimate disrespect for the working American citizen. If we can figure out how to get by on just $20k a year, they can figure out how to be happy with a whopping $174k salary.

To back up everything I'm saying: I'm refusing to take campaign money from any source other than small contributions from individuals. I'll also keep my political finances transparent and publicly available so that it's <b>crystal clear</b> I'm not being bought. As an added bonus, you can bet I'll also vote against <b>any and all increases to Congressional pay</b> and benefits, and vote <b>for</b> any and all legislation that reasonably limits Congressional compensation and bribery. Until working people in both Texas and the rest of America are all able to live comfortably and securely, there's not a <b>single damn good reason</b> why any member of Congress should ever have the gall to want more than what they're already given.

I have nothing to hide, and am more than glad to publish my tax returns and other financial information. No organization can buy me because, at my heart, I'm a simple man who prefers to live simply. For as long as I live, no one will <b>ever</b> be able to subvert my intentions.

<h2>I'm Sincerely Here For You</h2>

If you've ever had the chance to meet me, then hopefully, my passion for fixing the mess we're in came through loud and clear. If not, you'll likely have at least a couple chances in the future to experience that firsthand. I've already traveled over a good part of the district over the past few months. In the near future, I'll visit every single county, some of them multiple times. The purpose is straightforward: if I'm going to actually represent you properly, I need to hear from as many of you as possible. I need to understand what problems the majority of you are <b>actually facing</b> right now so that I can actually <b>make sure I'm fixing the problems that need to be fixed</b>. To be sure, I've heard from a lot of you. But, this district is 780,000 people strong. And I've come nowhere close to hearing from as many of you as I'd like to.

Ask yourself: when was the last time Nathan Moran visited your district? When was the last time he went out of his way to ask you what you thought about any particular issue? How often does he actually reach out to you to touch base with what's happening in your life? For too many of the people I've already spoken with, none of these questions have satisfying answers. And what's worse, this behavior is <b>normal</b> across Senators and Representatives. That's completely unacceptable. How is <b>anyone<b/> supposed to believe that they're representing their constituents properly? Congressional Districts are large, yes; but, far too often, we see members of Congress spending their off-session time doing photo ops. Holding private meetings with donors and business owners. Pulling publicity stunts that don't actually do anything for their communities.

It's time we demanded more from our Congress members. That's why I'm basing a huge part of my campaign around taking the time to meet with you all face-to-face. To genuinely <b>hear you out and ask your opinions</b>. Every day a Congress member spends <b>prioritizing special interests</b> instead of <b>connecting with their constituents</b> is a day wasted. Worse, it's a direct <b>conflict of interest</b> in the very job <b>they're supposed to be doing</b>. There's no excuse for that. In an era where messaging, public speaking, and debate are broken down to a science, the inability or refusal to maintain healthy communication with voters is a <b>grievous failing</b>. I'm traveling, visiting, and connecting with you all constantly as proof that it <b>can</b> be done; our current Representative just chooses not to.

If elected, I'll <b>continue</b> to stay connected. Because, quite frankly, <b>that's the job</b>: <b>listening</b> to constituents and <b>working</b> to give them what they <b>need</b>. <b>Not</b> ignoring constituents, then telling them condescendingly why they need to <b>fall in line</b>.

<h2>I Have The Necessary Skills</h2>

As a programmer, I can tell you with certainty that the most important skills of my profession are actually <b>not</b> memorizing a programming language. That helps, but it's honestly secondary to a handful of other vital abilities. First and foremost, programmers need to be able to <b>analyze problems</b> within an unfamiliar field to break them down and <b>look for solutions</b> that address each part of the issue. This requires sharp attention to detail and a consistent internal understanding of logic. Secondly, programmers need to be oriented toward <b>collaboration and communication</b> within a team so that everyone share the important details clearly and give every viable solution a genuine try, rather than letting potentially better answers go unheard because of confusion or ego. Lastly, performing research on the fly is essential to both shoring up gaps in domain knowledge and finding the best answers available to any given problem. Good programmers become very proficient in teaching themselves whatever they need to know, as well as finding out whether the answers they need have been built before and can be reused for their current problem.

If we compare this to the most important work of a Congress member, the job requirements actually overlap a ton. In fact, laws can easily be likened to giant computer system, filled with thousands of components that give explicit directions on how to process various events, actions, and resources within our society. On top of that, I don't just have a degree in Computer Science: I also have a degree in Criminal Justice, with an emphasis on laws and procedure. I interned with a public defender's office as part of my degree program, and have regularly reviewed Congressional bills and high profile court decisions as they were publicly released. As a result, I'm perfectly comfortable reading and interpreting legal text. It's with these exact skills that I've identified many potential changes our government could make to fix the major problems facing our country today. It's also with these skills that I'm able to explain in layman's terms precisely why and how a number of the bills Congress has passed over the years have directly caused the situation we're in now.

<h2>In Summary</h2>

From reading through all of this, it's easy to see how you might think to yourself, "Wow, this person really wants to run for office!" But, the reality is... I kind of wish there were other suitable candidates instead of me. I don't like the popularity contests. I don't like the deception. I don't like the bullshit vitriol and hysteria-mongering. I'd be so much happier just working on building and fixing digital systems in peace. Remaining alone and unnoticed by the world.

The problem is, I think our political system <b>needs</b> more people like me. It's probably needed them for years, if I'm being honest. For a while, I guess I was just hoping that, if I kept waiting long enough, enough good people would step up that I wouldn't need to do anything. That's not happening, though. Sitting around and wishing for people to show up and do the work that needs to be done isn't working. I'm at the point where I realize that, if I don't step up to do the job, it might <b>never</b> fix itself without me. That feeling has gotten so bad lately that I just can't ignore it anymore. And I feel personally responsible for not having done anything sooner.
