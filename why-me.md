<h1>The Simplest Answer</h1>

I have the necessary skills to find <b>real, viable solutions</b> to our country's problems. I have the genuine desire to do right by the vast majority of <b>working-class Texans</b>, rather than cater to the insanely rich. Lastly, I have the dedication and integrity to outright refuse anything and everything that could compromise the purpose our founding fathers intended for members of Congress. That's the straightest answer, pure and simple. If that's all you needed to hear to convince you... great! On the other hand, if you need a little more detail on those three points, then please read on.

<h2>I Abide By Honest Principles</h2>

I don't own any stocks, shares, businesses, or even rental property. My car is serviceable, but not luxurious. My lifestyle is humble, rather than extravagent. And I have a deeply-held belief that the only income I should ever receive is the income I earn with my own two hands. If I'm not doing something that directly and logically translates to either work or trade, then I don't want to pull any income from it. <b>Especially</b> not if someone else is doing all the work. I'm a man of earnest convictions, raised with a fervent belief that success should be <b>earned</b>, rather than merely some coincidence of one's birth. Also, as long as no one's causing me trouble, I feel an obligation to keep from troubling them, in turn. The Golden Rule and all that.

What's more, I've lived in poverty before. I know exactly how hard life on low wages can be. And I also know exactly how far even the smallest amount of extra money can be stretched out for. At $174,000 a year... a truly large salary by <b>any</b> standard... no member of Congress has <b>any</b> excuse whatsoever to pander to special interests or lobbyists in exchange for money. Most Americans would <b>kill</b> to make that kind of salary, even just for a single year. To live on a Congress member's salary and <b>still</b> not be satisfied, in my eyes, is the ultimate disrespect for the working Texan. Yet, because of political corruption, that's exactly what we see all too often: elected officials selling their legislative power to the highest bidders.

To back up everything I'm saying: I'll not only pledge to take zero money from any source other than individual citizens' contributions, but also keep my political finances transparent and publicly available so that there is <b>no question whatsoever</b> as to my interests. I'll also vote against <b>any and all increases to Congressional pay</b> and benefits. Until working people in both Texas and the rest of America are all able to live comfortably and securely, there's not a <b>single damn good reason</b> why any member of Congress should ever have the gall to want more than what they're already given. I have nothing to hide, and am more than glad to publish my tax returns. No organization can buy me because, at my heart, I'm a simple man who prefers to live simply. And for as long as I live, no one will <b>ever</b> be able to buy me. Not without it becoming plainly and abundantly clear from my published financial records.

<h2>I'm Sincerely Here For You</h2>

If you've ever had the chance to meet me, then hopefully, my passion for fixing both this Texas district and the country at large came through loud and clear. If not, you'll likely have at least a couple chances in the future to do just that. I've already traveled all over the district over the past few months, and will be visiting nearly every county in the future multiple times. The purpose is straightforward: if I'm going to actually represent you properly, I need to hear from as many of you as possible. I need to listen to what problems the majority of you are <b>actually facing</b> right now. To be sure, I've heard from a lot of you. But, this district is 780,000 people strong. And I've come nowhere close to hearing from as many of you as I'd like to.

We all know Congress is full of rich folk. Over 90% of them are about as far from ordinary working class people as it gets. To add insult to injury, they spend next to no time whatsoever engaging their constituents on a regular basis. That's completely unacceptable. How is anyone supposed to believe that they're representing their constituents when they don't even take the time to talk to them? Congressional Districts are large, yes, but far too often, we see members of Congress spending their off-session time doing photo ops. Holding private meetings with donors and business owners. Pulling publicity stunts that don't involve hearing out the people they represent.

I think these are grievous mistakes. They're symptoms of a detachment that's become far too common. That's why I'm basing a huge part of my campaign around taking the time to meet with you all face-to-face and talk with you. Not just talk <b>at</b> you, but genuinely <b>hear you out and ask your opinions</b>. In my view, every day a Congress member spends doing something <b>other</b> than connecting with their constituents is a day wasted. And in the age of technology, there's no excuse for that. In an era where messaging, public speaking, and debate are broken down to a science, the inability or refusal to maintain healthy communication with voters is a <b>grievous failing</b>. I'm traveling, visiting, and connecting with you all constantly as proof that it <b>can</b> be done; our current representatives simply choose not to. If elected, I'll continue to stay connected because, quite frankly, this is <b>supposed to be their job: listening to constituents and working to give them what they're asking for</b>. NOT ignoring constituents, then telling them condescendingly why <b>they</b> need to <b>fall in line</b>.

<h2>I Have The Necessary Skills</h2>

As a programmer, I can tell you with certainty that the most important skills of my profession are actually <b>not</b> memorizing a programming language. That helps, but it's honestly secondary to a handful of other vital abilities. First and foremost, programmers need to be able to <b>analyze problems</b> within an unfamiliar field to break them down and <b>look for solutions</b> that address each part of the issue. This requires sharp attention to detail and a consistent internal understanding of logic. Secondly, programmers need to be oriented toward <b>collaboration and communication</b> within a team so that everyone share the important details clearly and give every viable solution a genuine try, rather than letting potentially better answers go unheard because of confusion or ego. Lastly, performing research on the fly is essential to both shoring up gaps in domain knowledge and finding the best answers available to any given problem. Good programmers become very proficient in teaching themselves whatever they need to know, as well as finding out whether the answers they need have been built before and can be reused for their current problem.

If we compare this to the most important work of a Congress member, the job requirements actually overlap a ton. In fact, laws can easily be likened to giant computer system, filled with thousands of components that give explicit directions on how to process various events, actions, and resources within our society. On top of that, I don't just have a degree in Computer Science: I also have a degree in Criminal Justice, with an emphasis on laws and procedure. I interned with a public defender's office as part of my degree program, and have regularly reviewed Congressional bills and high profile court decisions as they were publicly released. As a result, I'm perfectly comfortable reading and interpreting legal text. It's with these exact skills that I've identified many potential changes our government could make to fix the major problems facing our country today. It's also with these skills that I'm able to explain in layman's terms precisely why and how a number of the bills Congress has passed over the years have directly caused the situation we're in now.
