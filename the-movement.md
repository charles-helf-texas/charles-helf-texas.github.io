They say money wins politics. That's just common sense... right? Establishment groups bankrolled by the largest corporations and the richest individuals blow hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle on advertisements and consultants to orchestrate grand publicity campaigns that are, in theory, expertly designed to sway voters. According to common wisdom, independents and third parties simply don't have a chance because they can't possibly raise the funds necessary to compete with the two major parties. If you buy into this line of thinking, then what I'm doing must surely be an incredibly insane exercise in futility... right?

Except, there's a funny little caveat to all of this.

Let's take the 2024 election cycle for example. 369 races took place; that means 369 winners, and at least 369 losers. Of the 369 losers, 79 of them (about 21%) didn't spend a single dollar. Also of the 369 losers, 133 of them (about 36%) didn't even spend a full $100,000. Put another way: if we assume that each donor was only allowed to donate $1 to a candidate, this means that 57% (nearly 2/3) of the losing candidates couldn't muster the support of even 100,000 people. Why does this matter? The average Congressional District in the United States has a population of 760,000 people. If we're making the (very unlikely) assumption that every $1 equates to 1 voter, then it makes perfect sense as to why these candidates lost. They couldn't even get 13% of their district's support.
